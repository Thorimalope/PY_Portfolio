# **Portfolio BootCamp Reflection**

## **1. What I Learned**

The Project Y & CAPACITI Bootcamp gave me one of the broadest and most intensive learning experiences I’ve ever had. Over the 8 weeks, I explored multiple areas in tech and got hands-on exposure to real tools, platforms, and problem-solving environments.

### **Generative AI**

I learned how to use tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Hugging Face to improve the way I approach coding, planning, and debugging. I also gained confidence in prompt engineering and got a much better understanding of AI ethics and responsible use. Building small AI-driven mini-projects helped me see how powerful these tools can be in real development workflows.

### **Low-Code Development**

Working with **Microsoft Power Apps** and **Power Automate** taught me how to build business applications quickly and effectively. I learned to design user interfaces, automate processes, and even use AI assistants to help write formulas and logic. This made me more comfortable with prototyping and thinking through real business challenges.

### **Data Engineering Foundations**

I strengthened my SQL skills and learned how data flows through systems. I practiced writing queries, transforming datasets, and building Python ETL scripts. I also worked with cloud storage solutions, which helped me understand how data is stored, processed, and moved around in modern environments.

### **Cloud Engineering**

Learning both **AWS** and **Azure** gave me a good grounding in cloud fundamentals. I deployed apps, experimented with serverless functions, created VMs, and explored different storage and security features. The certification prep also helped me understand cloud concepts clearly and systematically.

### **DevOps & Integration**

Containerizing apps with Docker and building CI/CD workflows with GitHub Actions gave me insight into how real engineering teams maintain, test, and deploy applications. These tools helped me appreciate how important automation and consistency are in modern development.

### **Capstone Project**

In the final week, I combined everything I had learned—AI, cloud, data, automation, and development—and built a complete project. It was the best part of the bootcamp because it challenged me to think independently and create something meaningful from scratch.

## **2. My Technical Strengths**

Throughout the programme, I became more aware of the strengths I bring as a developer and technologist:

### **Comfort Across Multiple Tech Domains**

I can work confidently with data, cloud tools, low-code platforms, and AI-assisted development. This flexibility helps me adapt quickly regardless of the type of project.

### **Fast Learning & Problem Solving**

The bootcamp moved fast, and I learned to keep up by experimenting, asking questions, and using AI tools wisely. This made me more resourceful and confident.

### **AI-Driven Development**

Using AI as a development partner became one of my strongest skills. I now know how to use AI effectively to debug issues, speed up development, and explore different solution approaches.

### **Data Handling**

My SQL and Python skills improved significantly. I can now transform data, write queries, and build simple pipelines—skills that are valuable across many tech roles.

### **Cloud Deployment**

Deploying solutions on AWS and Azure helped me understand how applications are hosted and maintained in real-world environments.

### **Version Control & Agile Workflow**

Working with Git, GitHub, and Agile planning tools strengthened my ability to work in structured, collaborative environments.

## **3. How My Capstone Project Brought Everything Together**

My capstone project was a chance to apply the full range of what I learned. It combined:

- **Generative AI** for research, idea validation, and coding assistance
- **Low-code or Python development**, depending on the project components
- **Cloud deployment** using AWS or Azure services
- **Data engineering** concepts like SQL queries and ETL steps
- **DevOps practices** such as documentation, version control, and optional CI/CD
- **Agile-style planning**, breaking the project into manageable tasks

It showed me how all the pieces from the bootcamp connect in the real world and gave me a solid portfolio project I can continue building on.

## **4. My Goals Moving Forward**

This bootcamp has given me a strong foundation, and I’m excited to grow from here.

### **Technical Goals**

- Complete the **AWS Cloud Practitioner** and **AZ-900** certifications
- Choose a specialisation (cloud, data engineering, or AI-assisted development) and deepen my skills
- Build more end-to-end projects for my portfolio
- Improve my automation skills using Python and cloud services

### **Career Goals**

- Move into an entry-level role where I can apply everything I’ve learned
- Work on real-world systems that have meaningful impact
- Keep developing a versatile set of skills that make me adaptable in the industry

### **Personal Development Goals**

- Get better at explaining technical decisions clearly
- Improve my documentation practices
- Stay committed to continuous learning and exploring new technologies
